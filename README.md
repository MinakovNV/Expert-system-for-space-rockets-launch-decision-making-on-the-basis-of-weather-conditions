Expert system for space rockets launch decision-making on the basis of weather conditions.

Relevance of work:
The relevance of the expert system is to study the factors affecting the flight of space rockets and to create a system of space rockets launch decision-making on the basis of weather conditions, atmospheric pressure, humidity and wind force on the day of launch, that is why the development of this system is due to the practical value.

Objective of the work is to develop an expert system based on ADO technology and Object Oriented Delphi programming environment in order to reduce the likelihood of  space rockets falling, depending on humidity, atmospheric pressure, wind speed and weather conditions.

Formulated goal required the resolution of the following tasks:
1.	Carrying out the debrief and analysis of the existing expert systems used in various fields of knowledge.
2.	Carrying out a correlation analysis between launches and fallings of rockets and weather conditions on this day.
3.	 Modeling expert system, decision-making algorithms, rules.
4.	Development and testing of an expert system.
5.	Carrying out experiments.

Research methods: 
•	Theoretical (analysis, comparison, synthesis).
•	Practical (experimental research, the development of decision theory, modeling, UML modeling).

Target of research – the effect of weather conditions on the fall of space rockets to Earth, and the subject of research is the development of the expert system of space rockets launch decision-making, based on weather conditions.

The hypothesis is that the system is designed to determine the minimum risk probability up to 80% for launching space rockets.

The novelty of the work lies in multicriterion modeling system of space rockets launch decision-making with minimal risk, different in terms of correlation analysis between launches of rockets and weather conditions at this time.

Practical significance:
This development can be used by spaceports to make decisions on the launch of rockets, depending on weather conditions.

Implementation of the results:
Based on the results of scientific work, there was developed the expert system of rocket launch decision-making, depending on weather conditions.
